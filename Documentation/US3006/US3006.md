##1. Requirements
As User, I want to view, in real-time, the updates in the shared boards

##2. Analysis
-We need to create a HTML page with a shared board where the user can post image and text content using
the client application.
-When a user post something the changes should be shown in real-time without page refresments.
-We need to implement an HTTP server with AJAX.
-The client communcates with the HTML page through HTTP protocol.

##3. Sequence

-When the user connects to the Server with the Client application the server starts the HTTP server.
-The user sends a showBoardRequest with CODE 7 and no data in the DATA field.
-The server reads the request and replies with showBoardResponse with CODE 8 and with the URL of the shared board in the DATA field
-The client application reads the reply and opens the board.
